# Telegram VOIP library

This repository is originally intended to be a submodule of Telegram Desktop application. The present fork introduces standalone CMake build with an intention to build 3rd party Telegram clients with VOIP support.

## Standalone build with CMake

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j48
```
